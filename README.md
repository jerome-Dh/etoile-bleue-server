# Etoile Bleue Server

## About Etoile Bleue

Etoile Bleue is a lightweight web server that implements the HTTP/2 protocol.
It was designed to perform hybrid parallel execution to reduce query latency and then deliver high performance.
This project was formalized in university research.

## How to use

The project is organized in several sub-directories.
To compile this you can just use the included makefile by running the command
``$ make all`` then run it with ``$. /server`` command.

To change the port or host name, refer to the ``config.h`` file located in the ``headers`` directory before doing the compilation.
Many other configurations can be done by modifying this configuration file.

## Tests

When the server is running, it listens for all incoming connections on its port number, so you can use a browser such as Mozilla Firefox to try to get the `Ê»index.html`` page (this is the page by default provided by the server).

The ``www`` directory can be used to host other content that can be served by the server.

To stop the server, press the "Enter" key.
